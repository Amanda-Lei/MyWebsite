                <p>Currently, I am studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. I'm building this website so that you can get to know me and I can practice web-dev from scratch! It's very much a work in progress, so keep that in mind while you look around. And it may look different next time you stop by...</p>
